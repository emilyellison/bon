<h2>FAQ</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Your site is awesome... but free... How can I contribute?</li>
		<p>Excellent question! We appreciate all forms of money*
		at BeerOn. Or if you'd like to tell us how we can improve our
		site, shoot us an e-mail at:&nbsp;<a href='#'>BeerOn@gmail.com</a>.
		</p>
	<li>Why is BeerOn only located in Chicago?</li>
		<p>BeerOn is a very new company, and we wanted to create the 
		beer app in a city where we were familiar with the beer. This way 
		we could do accurate testing and make the best beer application 
		possible for you! Also, we may have wanted to use it ourselves
		when testing was finished...
